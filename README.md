NorthCoders News: Reddit-like full-stack application, consisting in a news aggregation board. Users can post new articles, comment and vote on them. Articles can be sorted out by different methods. Frontend built using React.js / CSS for the frontend.

I've decided not to use a template styling-wise in order to better learn how to use CSS.

The backend for this project can be found on the following link:

As soon as possible I'll be fixing minor bugs, such as a vote simbol not displaying on articles with no votes, and not being able to see the comments for an article as soon as you create it.
